# musicPlayer
This project was completed on freeCodeCamp
The Github Pages website for this project: https://oia20.github.io/musicPlayer/
After completing the project on free code camp I added a volume up and down button.

Technologies used:
- HTML
- CSS
- Vanilla JS

Problems faced/concepts learned:

- I initially had a hard time grasping callback/arrow functions which I learned about in making this project, but by the end of the project I became very comfortable with the syntax of using them.
- learned how to use the audio element constructor
- ternary operator to shorten if statements
- .sort
- .filter
- document.createElement to create an element from within js code
- aria-labels
